      <p>The Old Royal Naval College was originally designed as the Royal Hospital for Seamen in the 17th century, commissioned by King William and Queen Mary. The four classical buildings that comprise the college today, including the iconic twin domes, were constructed over 300 years ago by two of Britain's leading architects, Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor.</p>

          <h2>Chapel of St Peter & St Paul</h2>
          <p>Within the Old Royal Naval College, you'll find the gorgeous Chapel of St Peter & St Paul, which was rebuilt in 1779 after a devastating fire. The interior is breathtaking, with its richly decorated ceiling and walls, all so impeccably preserved that they appear freshly painted. The ceiling features a neo-classical design of squares and octagons, while the walls are adorned with beautiful portraits. The atmosphere inside is serene, offering a tranquil escape where you can easily lose track of time and never want to leave.</p>
