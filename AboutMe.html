                <h1>"Love to see people's smile when they try my bakeries. Let's embrace the beauty of home-made bakery"</h1>

                <p>After moving from HK to UK near the end of 2022, I have been self-learning bakery, and I really love it. 
                   In the summer of 2023, I started to learn how to write coding for webpage also. 
                   So, I have created this blog to share what I have been doing. I wish everyone can enjoy the beauty of home-made bakery, it's healthy and delicious.

                    It's still at the very beginning, I would keep on adding and enriching the content here.
